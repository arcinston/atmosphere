    Update `update_port:fixed_ips` policy for neutron policy server
    check to stay with RBAC rule.
    This issue is not affect much on service security as policy `update_port:fixed_ips`
    always comes next to `update_port`, but still we should honor
    SRABC design to add role member check on.
